    BlacksmithKilled:
      - "Seems like {0}, the resident blacksmith, must have been extremely unlucky. Five knives, fresh from {0}'s armory, were found plunged into their hands, feet and head, and pinned to the craftsman's table last night. Maybe the serial killer was hoping to expand their weapon collection alongside their organ one..."
    CultistKilled:
      - "{0} was found stabbed to death with a candlestick by their altar. The serial killer has struck again, regardless of race, language or religion! {0} was a Cultist."
    CupidKilled:
      - "The next morning, the villagers were heartbroken to find {0} a.k.a. Cupid split from head to toe. Strangely the heart was missing..."
    DrunkKilled:
      - "The villagers had hoped to meet {0} to compliment their Martell, but all they found in {0}'s home was a broken knife and liver. All those years of drinking led to a liver so hard that even the Serial Killer probably does not fancy it..."
    GuardianAngelKilled:
      - "{0} would normally have managed to fight off the serial killer, but it was an irony that the Guardian Angel's halo has extinguished. {0} is dead."
    GunnerKilled:
      - "Looks like {0} was caught napping last night! A gunshot was heard last night, but all there was was the remains of a gunner, with a bullet hole to the head and a stab to the torso. Clearly the serial killer has won."
    MayorKilled:
      - "Assassination! {0} the mayor was found pinned with a knife on the table while working overnight at the mayor office! Clearly it's the serial killer exacting revenge for the asylum robbing them of years of their life!"
    PrinceKilled:
      - "Bells ring across the village before the sunrise, as armed guards flood the streets investigating the disappearance of Prince {0}. No clues were discovered, but it is suspected that there is a Serial Killer on the loose..."
      - "{0}'s guards were caught napping last night. The royal remains of {0} were found, hung in various parts of the palace, having fallen prey to the knife. No amount of princely blood would deter a serial killer's blade."
    SeerKilled:
      - "The villagers wake up to a rotting corpse of {0}, split from head to toe, stabs all over. Strangely the brain was carefully extricated, as if it was a premonition that the village has lost their top brains. {0} was the Seer."
    PawnKilled:
      - "This night was expected to be quiet, but the villagers discovered {0} in the town square, missing several organs. It seems the killer was displeased with the pawn's efforts to protect {1}! In a tragic turn of events, {0}, who tried to protect {1}, became the victim of the serial killer. {2}"
    DefaultKilled:
      - "It seemed a quiet enough night for {0}, but they were wrong. The villagers gather in the morning to find {0} split from head to toe, but oddly the liver was missing... The serial killer has struck again! {1}"

      - "The sound of mournful howls can be heard across the village. A mistake has been made. The wolves have killed one of their own. The Sorcerer {0} is dead."
      - "Cries of 'I'm your ally!' were heard last night. All the villagers found next morning were an exhumed body and smashed mystical ball, belonging to {0}, the sorcerer. Hunger trumps comradeship..."
    WildChildEaten:
      - "NOMNOMNOMNOM! The wolves were heard last night, eating up a tender Wild Child, {0}, leaving behind only a reduced-size skeleton! The village wondered if the wolves felt any guilt tearing apart the defenceless child."
    PawnEaten:
      - "Last Night, {0} made the ultimate sacrifice, willingly offering themselves to protect {1} in the ongoing battle against the werewolves. Their selfless act, a beacon of courage, leaves an indelible mark on the village. May the village find solace in the courage shown by {0}, the Pawn who became a legend in the village. {2}"
    DetectiveEaten:
      - "The villagers gather in the morning, but do not see {0}. They wander over to the house, to find {0} disemboweled, an old badge shoved down their throat."
    GuardianEaten:
      - "Morning comes, and to everyone's dismay, impaled on top of the church's cross is {0}, the Guardian Angel \U0001F47C."
    GunnerEaten:
      - "As everyone comes out of their houses, they find pieces of a shotgun strewn about... then legs... then fingers... then the body of {0}, floating in the fountain in the town square, dead from a werewolf attack. You have lost your gunner \U0001F52B."
    SeerEaten:
      - "The villagers awake in the morning, to find the disemboweled remains of {0} hunched over a Ouija board and tarot cards. The Seer \U0001F473 is dead."

    DefaultEaten:
      - "As everyone rises in the morning, they smell a terrible stink. They follow the smell to find {0} shredded apart in the pig pen, head missing. NOMNOMNOMNOM\n{1}"
    HarlotEaten:
      - "The harlot chose the wrong night to stay home. {0} has been eaten by the wolves!"
