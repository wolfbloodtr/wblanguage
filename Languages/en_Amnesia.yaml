    HunterKillsWolfEnd:
    - "Knowing only {0} was left, {1} tries to eat {0} up, but {0}'s military training and paranoia proves too much to handle! All there is left is a carcass with two shots to the torso and the last man standing: the victorious hunter for the village!"
    WolfKillsHunterEnd:
    - Knowing only {0} was left, {1} chose a time where {0}'s guard was at their lowest. Eliminating the final villager proved to be effortless for {1}, for all there remains is a mutiliated body of {0}, the hunter, adorned with parallel slashes to the face.
    CHKillsCultistEnd:
    - "{1} and {0} walk out in daylight. Seeing a shimmering cross worn around {0}'s neck, the righteous {1} draws their sword for the final time, putting an end to the twisted learnings of the cult that have contaminated the village."
    TannerEnd:
    - As the sun starts to shine on the village, {0} wakes to the sound of silence. Realising there was no one left, {0} walks and walks, until they stand alone in the middle of the village. Looking at the sight of the corpses strewn all across the village, {0} sighs. Their lifelong dream of being chosen to be lynched by the villagers is as dead as the villagers are. They reach out and touch the rope, that had taken many lives, tenderly, before slipping it around their neck and letting themselves hang freely, with a sad smile on their face.
    - '{0} wakes up at dawn, alone. {0} sees how abject a failure they has been, not being able to get the village to satisfy their masochistic desires of being lynched to death. {0} grabs a rope and hangs himself, realising no one can accomplish their dream, since there is no one left.'
    SorcererEnd:
    - '{0} opens their eyes, but instead of hearing the usual bustle of the village, they are met with silence. They stare at the dreary ceiling, letting reality slowly sink in. Everyone was dead. The wolves were dead. With a pang in their heart, {0} gets up, and packs their things, before walking to the edge of the village. A tear slips from their eye, as {0} recalls how close they and their wolves were to victory. Alas, it was time to start a new life, with a new pack. {0} slips into the darkness of the forest, away from the quiet village.'
    - For all of {0}'s efforts, {0}'s wolf friends lay motionless and lifeless. Even if the wolves have been brought victory, there is no one to savour the success with, neither are there any living villagers to mock at. {0} peers into the crystal ball, and silently disappears, in a cloud of fog, in search of new wolves, new allies, and new treachery to commit new crimes against humanity.
    DoppelgangerEnd:
    - "Ah! How miserable can the life of someone, who is not even able to do the only task they were made for, be? Is the ability of taking the appearance of others only a legend? We will never know!\n{0} is now alone in the village and there is nobody to mimic. The only thing they can do is copy the person in the mirror!"
    ThiefEnd:
    - As {0} wanders around the village, they found out that there are no more fun roles available for them to steal. They quickly left this poor village and search for another village to restart their illustrious career.
